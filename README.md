## Repository Role

This repository is the **command-line binary only**. The evaluation engine lives in [`shipyard-core`](https://github.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-core) and is consumed as a Go module dependency.

| Repository | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`shipyard-core`](https://github.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-core) | Evaluation engine, agent plugins, sandboxes, ATIF capture, rubrics. Go library. |
| **`shipyard-cli`** (this repo) | The `shipyard` binary, cobra commands, and release pipeline. |
| [`shipyard-web`](https://github.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-web) | Documentation site and marketing pages. |
| [`shipyard-ci`](https://github.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-ci) | CI/CD integrations that gate evals in your pipelines. |
| [`shipyard-registry`](https://github.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-registry) | Prebuilt evalsets and reference agents. |

---

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux, amd64 or arm64
- Docker, for `docker` sandbox environments (use `--env local` to run without it)
- `python3`, because the engine runs every rubric as `python3 <script>`
- `git`, since evalsets may reference remote agent repositories

**There is no Go requirement to install Shipyard.** You install a prebuilt
binary. See [Why you cannot `go install` this](#why-you-cannot-go-install-this).

---

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

That installs the latest **stable** release, currently `v0.0.1`. The
installer verifies the SHA256 checksum before writing anything, and it only
needs `curl` and `tar`.

```bash
# follow the test channel while you evaluate a new CLI
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-cli/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --channel test

# pin an exact version, which is what you want in CI
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-cli/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --version v0.0.1
```

| Channel | Tracks | Use for |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `stable` | latest non-prerelease | production |
| `test` | latest `-alpha` / `-beta` / `-rc` | validating a release against your evals |
| `dev` | latest `-dev` build | debugging the CLI itself |

Or run it as a container, which is the easiest way to get Docker-in-Docker
sandboxing:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/src" -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  ghcr.io/shivam-jainn/shipyard-cli:latest run ./my-eval
```

Verify, and uninstall:

```bash
shipyard version     # version, CLI commit, engine commit, channel
./install.sh --uninstall
```

### Why you cannot `go install` this

The evaluation engine, [`shipyard-core`](https://github.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-core),
is a **private** repository. This module depends on it through a filesystem
`replace` directive, and the Go toolchain explicitly refuses to install any
module whose `go.mod` contains one:

```
The go.mod file for the module providing named packages contains one or
more replace directives. It must not contain directives that would cause
it to be interpreted differently than if it were the main module.
```

So `go install github.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-cli/cmd/shipyard@latest` cannot
work — for you, for CI, or for anyone else. That is why distribution is
artifacts-only: checksummed release tarballs and a container image.

This also means you can read this repository's source but **cannot build it**,
because the engine is unreachable. That is intended.

### Building from source

You need access to the private engine, plus Go 1.26+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-cli.git
cd shipyard-cli
git clone https://github.com/shivam-jainn/shipyard-core.git ../shipyard-core

make init
make build
make version     # what this tree would publish
```

---

## Quickstart

```bash
shipyard init eval fix-memory-leak
shipyard run ./fix-memory-leak
```

Inspect what ran:

```bash
shipyard version          # which build this is
cat fix-memory-leak/rollouts/*/metrics.json
```

Rollouts are written to `<eval-path>/rollouts/<run-id>/` containing
`trajectory.json`, `metrics.json`, `rubrics.json`, and `artifacts/`.

---

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `shipyard init` | Scaffold an `eval` or `evalset` from a built-in template. |
| `shipyard run` | Execute an eval or evalset and score it. |
| `shipyard version` | Print the active version. |
| `shipyard completion` | Generate a shell completion script. |

### Useful flags for `shipyard run`

- `--agent <name>`: Override the agent driver.
- `--provider <name>`: Override the LLM provider (`openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `ollama`, ...).
- `--model <name>`: Override the model name.
- `--command <cmd>`: Override agent execution command.
- `--env <type>`: Override the sandbox type (`docker`, `local`, `custom`).
- `--keep-env`: Retain the sandbox after completion for post-mortem debugging.

### Runtime overrides

Agents, models, providers, and sandbox environments can be swapped on the fly without editing config files.

---

## Development

```bash
make test      # run unit and integration tests
make build     # cross-compile (GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 make build)
make clean     # remove build artifacts
```

Version stamping is injected at link time and can be overridden at runtime with the `SHIPYARD_VERSION` environment variable.

---

## Releases

Shipyard publishes to three channels, and the tag alone decides which:

| Tag | Channel | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `v1.2.3` | `stable` | GitHub release + `:latest`, `:stable`, `:<version>` images |
| `v1.2.3-rc.1` | `test` | prerelease + `:test` image |
| `v0.0.0-dev.42` | `dev` | prerelease + `:dev` image |

Stable tags must be reachable from `main`; test and dev tags from `develop`.
The pipeline refuses to publish otherwise, so a release cannot be cut from the
wrong branch.

Every release cross-compiles for linux and darwin on amd64 and arm64, strips
symbols and local paths, smoke-tests the linux/amd64 binary, and publishes
SHA256 checksums, an SPDX SBOM, and a build-provenance attestation.
